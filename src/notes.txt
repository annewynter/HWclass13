Instance variables:
variables which are declared outside a method, loop, constaructor or
a block of code, but inside a class without static keyword are called
instant variables.
we call them instance variables, because for each object of that class a new copy
of the variables is created in memory.
when to use:
when a value is expected to change from object to object we should declare an instance
variable for those values.
Static variables:
instance variables with a static keyword are called static variables.
They are called class level variables because their value is same across all the
objects and only one memory allocation is occupaied from the main memory.
When should we use it:
when a value is expected to stay the same, when we have to share something
across all the objects - we should store this info in a static variable.
Mostly it's used as constance.
As a good practice we should access it using the class names.

Local variables:
variables which are declared inside a method or loop or switcj case or any block of
code are called local variables.
we cannot use static keyword with local variables.
Local variables occupy the memory in computer for the shortest period of
time.

Static methods:
we can have static methods as well but static methods cannot access instance
variables while not static methods can access static as well as not
static or instance variables.
